INTRODUCTION
------------
This project completes the Formstack QA Analyst Assignment.  All files, php, css, js are included and can be run locally or Server.

REQUIREMENTS
------------

 * PHP Server

INSTALLATION
------------
 
 * For local installation, I recommend MAMP for setting up a local environment.  
 
TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------

 * If the buttons do not display, check the following:

   - Is my form id more than 6 characters long?

   - If the form id is automatically populated because you recently entered a form id, try click off the form id button field to show buttons.
   
   - If Step #5 continues to return 0% success, then try using an older Form ID.  
   - If Step #5 shows a response code other than 200, but your success rate is >0% it's because the last form it tried to capture failed.
